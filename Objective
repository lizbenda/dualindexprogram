Objective: 
Have user input indices used and have program tell them which ones to add for color-balancing

Other option would be user puts in indices and program tells them if it is balanced or not ( for instances when 1 sample prep fails out of 8 etc)

Data I have: 
Color balancing worksheet, names of single libraries. 

What I need to do: 
make and import index data
tell program what indices work, don't work for color balancing
design a prompt for users to imput indices, without too much "coding"
